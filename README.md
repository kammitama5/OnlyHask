# OnlyHask
Only solve algorithms in Haskell

## CTCI
- My friend and I are going through algorithms weekly.
  I thought I'd try to solve what I can in Haskell.
- This is just a random repo; my bigger goal is to build actual projects,
  not just do challenges in Haskell. This is a good opportunity to
  also look at better ways of solving the same problems over time.
